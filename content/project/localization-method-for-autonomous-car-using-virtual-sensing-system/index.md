I worked with five of my friends on conducting research in utilizing neural networks to improve vehicle state estimation. Responsibilities include:

* Designing a sensor fusion module incorporation data from accelerometer, gyroscope, GNSS, and neural networks using the Error-State Kalman Filter algorithm
* Designing a recurrent neural networks model
* Publishing a [conference paper](../../publication/localization-method-for-autonomous-car-using-virtual-sensing-system/) 

<b>Tools &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; :</b> Python, CARLA Simulator, LaTeX<br>
<b>Libraries &nbsp; :</b> Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas<br>
