<b>Supervisor &#58;</b> [Prof. Yul Yunazwin Nazaruddin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rve3vEYAAAAJ&hl=en)

I  worked on data-driven longitudinal-model identification and optimization of longitudinal controller in CARLA Simulator. I was also a mentor of two new bright members, i.e. [Alif Rizqullah Mahdi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alifrmahdi/?originalSubdomain=id) and [Karina Ardellia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karina-ardellia-281066190/?originalSubdomain=id). My responsibilities include:

* Conducting research and simulation on optimization of longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles
* Provided tutorials about basic optimization, nature-inspired optimization algorithms, and CARLA Simulator
* Publishing a [journal article](../../publication/longitudinal-control-optimization-fpa/)

<b>Tools &emsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; :</b> Python, CARLA Simulator, LaTeX<br>
<b>Libraries &nbsp; :</b> Numba, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas<br>
