Hello. I am an AI engineer at [Neurabot](https://neurabot.io/en) working on microscopic image analysis using Deep Learning and Image Processing techniques. Currently, my main research interest is the application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning in medical imaging area.

I received my BSc degree in Physics Engineering from Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) with the Cum Laude predicate. During my last year on the university, I worked on Self-Driving Cars research, especially on Control Systems and State Estimation. I was a member of the [ICoDeS](https://ik.fti.itb.ac.id/lab-icodes/) Laboratory under [Prof. Yul Y. Nazaruddin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rve3vEYAAAAJ&hl=en) supervision.

You may want to take a look at my recent [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bGpBmoXHx90vCNmVadjozmWJA91_dFrh/view?usp=sharing) to obtain my complete information.
